4. Quiz App
   - Objectives: Work with arrays of questions, track user progress, and provide feedback based on answers.
   - Practice: Arrays, objects, loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation.
   - Features: Multiple-choice questions, score tracking, feedback.

   - Checkpoints:
     1. Create an array of question objects. = DONE
     2. Build the UI for displaying questions and options. = DONE
     3. Add logic to check answers and track score.
     4. Show feedback after each question. = DONE (clrs do this)
     5. Display final score and allow restart. = DONE
     6. Style the app for engagement (Do this at home to use 2nd screen. Media queries to be done)

   - Topics to cover before starting:
     * Basics & Fundamentals
     * Working with Data
     * DOM Manipulation

  
  - Improvements that can be made:
    1. Don't hide/show buttons repeatedly in loops.
    2. Make button logic cleaner/reusable:
    2.1 Add the buttons into helper functions and call those where needed.
    2.2 e.g. showNextBtn(), hideNextBtn(), showCompleteBtn(), hideCompleteBtn()
    3. Reset button styles between card loads.
    4. Wrap the initalization into one function at run this on loading and when retry button is clicked
    4.1 It can look someting like this:
      function startQuiz() {
        questionCount = 0;
        correctAnswers = 0;
        container.innerHTML = "";
        finalCard.style.display = "none";
        container.style.display = "block";
        hideNextButton();
        hideCompleteButton();
        cardStyle(questionBank[questionCount]);
      }
    5. Seperate logic and UI into different files.
  
  -Things to develop later:
    1. Add logic to disabled DONE-button 
      * This will eventually go to a leader board
      * The score should be saved persistently in a database
      * The score can be graphed over time.
    2. Build a login page
    3. Make it a mobile app as well.
